# Instructions: How to Run the Project
After you finish downloading the project, unzip the project file and head over to your XAMPP directory. 
There you’ll find a folder named “htdocs”. 
Inside the “htdocs” folder, paste the project folder (not the .zip one, but the extracted one).
Open your favorite browser; I recommend using Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. 
Then, go to the URL “http://localhost/phpmyadmin“. Create a Database with the name "db_lms". More that is provided inside the “LOGIN DETAILS.txt”. 
Click on the “Import” tab and choose the database file (.sql) which is provided under the folder naming “DATABASE”. 
After setting up all these, go to the URL “http://localhost/LoanSystem/" 
Enter Username: admin Enter Password: test1234 
All the login details are provided inside the project folder, check that out and enter them in order to use it.
